=================

These certificates were collected from Apple, Entrust, Globalsign, DigiCert, Comodo, GoDaddy, Trustwave and XRamp, Verisign/Symantec/GeoTrust/Thawte (all one company), and StartCom. More will be added. 187 of these certificates were issued by Comodo.

If you plan to use this repository, note the following:
- files are either DER encoded or PEM encoded, and the file extension is **not** an indicator of encoding
- omissions may occur, either because they were issued after the last update or the CA failed to disclose it with Mozilla and/or in their repository
